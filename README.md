# Diploma_Thesis

The present diploma thesis examines and compares methods about extraction of
components of linear mixed signals, based on BSS model, that refer to the voltage
that heart produces.
The algorithms that presented and implemented in Python are FastICA with ne-
gentropy criterion and Ï€CA with periodity of each component as criterion.
Finally, the above methods are applied in synthesized periodic signals as well as
abdfecgd database from Physionet and DaISy database, and compared with the
use of proper criteria for their correctness.
